# Kingdom of Knowledge
A trivia-style game which quizzes users on high school math with elevated user interaction using power-ups and bonuses based on roles. 

Created using Visual Basic 6.0, Kingdom of Knowledge is an educational game that teaches the user math concepts and then quizzes them on the knowledge. This was my first big project with computer programming. In the game, users rack up points and earn power-ups, varying dependent on the class type picked.

# Focus of the Project
High-school level math taught through a quiz format game, similar to trivia games. The units taught are Algebra, Quadratic Functions, Analytic Geometry, and Trigonometry. All the units are broken down into separate chapters, and each chapter includes a lesson, allowing the user to learn the unit at a slower pace, rather than providing the information necessary for the game in one form. Each lesson includes visuals to help the user learn, and can be referenced in the help form.
